REQUIREMENTS ~

INSTALLATION ~

`utils.nvim` is not meant to be installed by itself, but rather as a dependency
for another plugin.

If you are building a plugin that requires the utilities provided by
`utils.nvim`, you can add it as a dependency as shown below:

>lua
    -- Lazy
    {
        'yourname/plugin.nvim',
        dependencies = {
            '2kabhishek/utils.nvim'
        },
    },
<


CONFIGURATION

`utils.nvim` can optionally be configured by specifying `opts` with Lazy or
alternatively with the `setup` function like so:

>lua
    -- Lazy opts:
    {
        'yourname/plugin.nvim',
        dependencies = {
            {
                '2kabhishek/utils.nvim',
                opts = {
                    -- 'telescope', 'fzf_lua', or 'snacks' (default)
                    picker_provider = "snacks",
                }
            }
        },
    }
    
    -- using `setup` function:
    require("utils").setup({
        picker_provider = "telescope"
    })
<

BEHIND THE CODE                                        *utils-behind-the-code*


INSPIRATION ~

utils.nvim was created while working on octohub.nvim
<https://github.com/2kabhishek/octohub.nvim> which relied on a lot of common
utilities like async shell execution, notifications, and caching.


CHALLENGES/LEARNINGS ~

- Figuring out the callback mechanism for async functions was a bit tricky.
- Learned better ways to handle caching and notifications.
