INSPIRATION ~

utils.nvim was created while working on octohub.nvim
<https://github.com/2kabhishek/octohub.nvim> which relied on a lot of common
utilities like async shell execution, notifications, and caching.


CHALLENGES/LEARNINGS ~

- Figuring out the callback mechanism for async functions was a bit tricky.
- Learned better ways to handle caching and notifications.
